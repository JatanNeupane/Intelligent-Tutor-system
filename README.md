Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS)

Overview

The Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) is an educational tool designed to assist students in understanding and calculating the areas of geometric shapes. 
This system combines a user-friendly interface with backend logic, leveraging an OWL (Web Ontology Language) file for intelligent reasoning and integration.
